# Pomodoro Timer App

## Overview
This Python program implements a Pomodoro Timer, a time management technique that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The program has a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library.

## Features
- Timer Modes: The program has three modes - Work, Short Break, and Long Break. It cycles through these modes based on the Pomodoro technique.
- Customizable Durations: Users can set custom durations for work time, short breaks, and long breaks using spinboxes.
- Visual Cues: The GUI displays a tomato image representing the Pomodoro, and the timer countdown is shown on the tomato. 
The title label changes color to indicate the current mode (Work, Short Break, or Long Break).
- Start, Reset, and Check Marks: Users can start the timer, reset it, and keep track of completed Pomodoro cycles with check marks.
- Executable Application: The program has been packaged into an executable (.exe) file for easy usage without requiring Python installation.

## Libraries Used
- Tkinter: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- Math: Utilized for mathematical operations, specifically for calculating minutes and seconds during countdown.
  
## How to Use
1. Download the Application:
- Download the application from the provided link or repository.
- Ensure that the executable file (Pomodoro_Timer_App.exe) is saved on your computer.

2. Run the Application:
- Double-click on the executable file (Pomodoro_Timer_App.exe) to launch the Pomodoro Timer application.

3. Set Durations:
- On the GUI, set the desired durations for work time, short breaks, and long breaks using the provided spinboxes.

4. Start the Timer:
- Click the "Start" button to initiate the Pomodoro Timer.
- The timer will cycle through work and break intervals, and the tomato image will visually indicate the current mode.

5. Reset the Timer:
- Click the "Reset" button to stop the timer and reset it to its initial state.

6. Track Pomodoro Cycles:
- Completed Pomodoro cycles are represented by check marks on the GUI.

## Notes
- Ensure that the application file (Pomodoro_Timer_App.exe) and the image file (tomato.png) are in the same directory.
- The program uses a standard Pomodoro cycle of 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of short break, and 15 minutes of long break.
- The application is designed for simplicity and ease of use, making it a handy tool for time management.
